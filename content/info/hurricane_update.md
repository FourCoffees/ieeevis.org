# Developments on the impact of Hurricane Helene

*Posted on Friday, September 27 2024 at 8:45pm EDT*


Dear Visualization Community,


This evening, members of the core committee, VEC, and IEEE met with the TradeWinds Island Grand Hotel manager for an update on the status of the damages. Unfortunately, the damages are significant enough that we will be unable to hold IEEE VIS 2024 on their property, and we have invoked force majeure to cancel the contract.



Our team at IEEE is currently searching for an alternative venue in the Tampa/Orlando area that would still allow us to hold an in-person event around the same time. However, switching to a completely virtual event remains an option. We hope to have information about this by the middle of next week.



For those who booked hotel rooms at the TradeWinds Island Grand or RumFish through our room block, these rooms should be canceled automatically. However, if you have questions, you can contact the hotel at +1 800-360-4016 or e-mail at GroupReservations@twresort.com.



We realize this impacts flights, registration, and potentially many other things. However, we donâ€™t have any more information than what has been shared above. We will do our best to communicate updates as they become available.



Sincerely,

IEEE VIS 2024 General Chairs

# Update on the impact of Hurricane Helene

*Posted on Friday, September 27 2024 at 12:42 EDT*

As you may have heard, Hurricane Helene had a significant impact on Florida. Although Tampa / St. Pete did not receive a direct hit, the storm surge caused significant flooding. The good news is that they are used to dealing with these situations in Florida.
**At this point, we still plan to go ahead with the in-person portion of the conference at the TradeWinds Island Grand.**

However, the situation is still evolving, and we wanted to share the information we have with you at this time.
- The RumFish Hotel had no significant damage.
- The TradeWinds Island Grand Hotel has endured flooding. However, a flood mitigation team is already on site assessing and repairing the damage. As soon as we know the extent of the flooding and/or damage and if it affects the in-person conference, we will let everyone know.
- As a precaution, all reservations at the TradeWinds Island Grand Hotel before Oct 11 have been canceled. If your plans had you arriving before Oct 11, we will follow up with additional information.

We will continue to update you with additional information as we have relevant details to share.

Sincerely,

VIS 2024 General Chairs
