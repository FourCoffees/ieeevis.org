# Update on the impact of Hurricane Helene

*Posted on Friday, September 27 2024*

As you may have heard, Hurricane Helene had a significant impact on Florida. Although Tampa / St. Pete did not receive a direct hit, the storm surge caused significant flooding. The good news is that they are used to dealing with these situations in Florida.
**At this point, we still plan to go ahead with the in-person portion of the conference at the TradeWinds Island Grand.**

However, the situation is still evolving, and we wanted to share the information we have with you at this time.
- The RumFish Hotel had no significant damage.
- The TradeWinds Island Grand Hotel has endured flooding. However, a flood mitigation team is already on site assessing and repairing the damage. As soon as we know the extent of the flooding and/or damage and if it affects the in-person conference, we will let everyone know.
- As a precaution, all reservations at the TradeWinds Island Grand Hotel before Oct 11 have been canceled. If your plans had you arriving before Oct 11, we will follow up with additional information.

We will continue to update you with additional information as we have relevant details to share.

Sincerely,
VIS 2024 General Chairs
