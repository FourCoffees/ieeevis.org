As part of IEEE VIS's ongoing efforts to engage with our community, the IEEE VIS governance bodies are seeking feedback from the VIS community! 

Join us from *12:00PM* to *1:30PM* Wednesday October 16th at Room TBD, and via [streaming](TBD).

Learn more about what the IEEE VIS governing bodies took on as priorities for VIS 2024 and come suggest priorities for the IEEE VIS governing bodies to address as we move towards VIS 2024. All members of the VIS community are welcome!

Questions from the community are welcome during the townhall. A larger update on various other committees can be found here.
