VisLies! is a yearly event at IEEE VIS. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community. Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and insights that may one day save the world (!). For more information about VisLies!, or to check out our gallery of annotated examples from past events, please visit our website at [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).

Do you like to ride a bicycle? Are you interested in seeing more of St. Pete/Clearwater? Then join us for Le Tour de VIS!
We will meet during the conference to prepare and review the post-conference ride which will happen on Saturday (Oct 19). You don’t need to bring your lycra or even a bike to join the ride (we will arrange rentals), but you do need to be comfortable biking about 100km/60 miles and observing cycling safety rules.

For past tours, see: [https://www.gicentre.net/velo-club-rides](https://www.gicentre.net/velo-club-rides)

For the last 5 years, Vis4Good [(https://vis4good.github.io/](https://vis4good.github.io/) has provided a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society in order to build just and equitable futures. Data is an inescapable part of our lives: it guides commerce, government, and technology, and increasingly determines what lives we can (or cannot) live. Data visualization has a special place within this emerging, data-driven, order: as a tool to inform or persuade mass audiences, guide or enlighten the specialist, or give a voice to the unheard. We therefore pose the question: how can visualization, and visualization research, help us build the worlds we want? 

## <a name="reproducibility"></a>A Reproducibility Stamp Initiative for Visualization?

The Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (GRSI;[https://www.replicabilitystamp.org/](https://www.replicabilitystamp.org/) has been certifying the reproducibility of papers published in certain graphics-related journals since 2017, and some of these journals also include visualization work (in particular, TVCG and, thus, VIS papers). However, while the GRSI is continuing to extend to new venues (recently SIGGRAPH conference papers), they do not seem to be interested in adding pure visualization venues. We would like to  discuss if and how we should react as a visualization community who also wants for their publications to have opportunities to get reproducibility certified.
