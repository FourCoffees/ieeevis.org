This page provides information about the technical configuration for hybrid presenting and attendance of IEEE VIS 2024. Presentations in a session will be made in-person or live over a virtual Zoom Webinar. Viewing of sessions will also be hybrid: either in-person or remotely over a live YouTube broadcast.

**In the week leading up to the conference. All event organizers, session chairs, and presenters will receive technical details about the session they are involved in.**


## Attendee Information
All sessions will have an in-person presence - to be projected on a screen in the conference room. All sessions will be virtually streamed out through YouTube - the live broadcasts (and subsequent recordings) will be available on the conference web page. 

### Q+A and Discussion
Question and Answer (Q+A) for each presentation or panel will occur in person with a microphone and remotely over Slido. The session chair or event organizers will be responsible for fielding questions during the Q+A portions of each session. All attendees will also be able to participate in the discussion through the conference’s Discord channel.

### Closed Captions
Closed captions will be available to attendees through each session’s Zoom Webinar. For closed caption purposes, attendees can find the Zoom Webinar link to each session’s page. Closed captions are automatically generated by Zoom.

### In-Person Presenters
In-person presentations will continue as in years past - with presenters connecting their personal laptops to the in-room conference computer via HDMI. This year, a static video camera will record the presenter at the podium; that camera stream will be included as a picture-in-picture in the virtual live stream. The picture-in-picture will appear in the top-right of the video stream. 

**In-person Presenter Check-List:**
1. Charge your laptop before your session.
2. Clear the laptop’s desktop of any applications and pause notifications that might interrupt your presentation.
3. Test the connection of your laptop to the conference A/V system. Check that your slides appear correctly and your laptop audio works (if laptop audio is used during the presentation).
4. Check that important slide content is not occluded by the picture-in-picture at the top right of slides.


### Virtual Presenters
Virtual presentations will take place over a live Zoom Webinar - with presenters sharing their screen, camera, and audio over Zoom. Virtual presenters should be listed as “panelists” in the Zoom Webinar in order to present.

**Virtual Presenter Check-List:**
1. [Install Zoom Desktop](https://zoom.us/download) before your session.
2. Create and log in to your Zoom account (can be any school or personal account).
3. [Grant Zoom permissions for macOS](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0064868). Zoom needs permissions for “Camera”, “Microphone”, and “Screen and System Audio Recording.”
4. If presenting with system audio (i.e. you intend to play a video with sound during your presentation), be sure to [share computer audio when sharing your screen](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063608#h_01GBXFBZ8GBD3Z3YV70YRETA7Y). 
5. Test your internet connection and screen sharing. Join the Zoom Webinar for your session 15 minutes prior to the start.

## Info for Associated Events, Workshops, Tutorials, and Panels
Sessions for these event types will all have hybrid capabilities for presenters and attendees. Please note, that all presenters (including virtual) must register for the conference. The registration includes a video release form that is needed to be included in the conference sessions.

It is up to the event’s organizers' discretion what hybrid capabilities they require. All of these capabilities will be used by default. Event organizers should communicate to the Tech Chairs if any capabilities should not be used. These capabilities include: 
- In-person presentation via a personal laptop that connects to the conference computer using HDMI. Laptop screen and audio sharing will appear on the projector screen. Also, screen and audio will be shared via Zoom Webinar for 2-way communication with virtual presenters.
- In-person microphones will connect to the conference room audio system. Microphone audio will be shared via Zoom Webinar for 2-way communication. 3 microphones will be available in every room (panel sessions will include 5 microphones).
- In-person static video camera will be pointed at the podium. The stream from this video will appear as a picture-in-picture over the top right of the current laptop screen being shared.
- Virtual presenters can share screen, video, and audio as “panelists” over the Zoom Webinar. These media sources will appear on the in-person projector screen. The A/V Student Volunteer must switch the input source to the Zoom Webinar. Event organizers will need to communicate when a virtual presenter will be presenting to the A/V Student Volunteer in the conference room.
- Streaming of the entire session to a live YouTube broadcast. The YouTube stream will appear unlisted on the ieeevis.org page for the session. After the conference ends, an edited version of the recording will be made public.
- Discord channel for discussion. The link will be on the session page.
- Sli.do channel for Q+A. The link will be on the session page.
- Zoom Webinar automated closed captioning. The link will be on the session page and QR code in each room.

The week before the conference, the Tech Chairs will send an email with the above technical details for their session (e.g. Zoom Webinar links, YouTube link). That email will include a list of the expected paper presentations. Any presenter for an associated event paper will be included as a “panelist” in the Zoom Webinar. If additional presenters need to be added, event organizers can submit those additional names and emails for presenters to the Tech Chairs.

## Info for Full, Short & Invited TVCG/CGA Papers
To simplify the conference format for paper track sessions. Paper sessions have been scheduled based on the presenter’s mode of presentation. Therefore there will be paper sessions that are entirely in-person presentations and paper sessions that are solely from virtual presenters. Both of these session types can be viewed by conference attendees in person or remotely via the YouTube broadcast for that session.

### In-Person Presentation Sessions
In-person presentation will occur as in years past, via a personal laptop that connects to the conference computer using HDMI. The presenter’s laptop screen and audio will appear on the projector screen and over the room’s audio system. The presenter will speak using a microphone at the podium that connects to the conference room audio system. Also, a static video camera will be pointed at the presenter on the podium. The stream from this video will appear as a picture-in-picture over the top right of the speaker’s presentation. 

[See above for an in-person presenter checklist](#in-person-presenters).

### Virtual Presentation Sessions
Virtual presentation will occur over a Zoom Webinar. **All presenters must join the Zoom Webinar 15 minutes before the start of their session to test screen, video, and audio sharing.** Presenters will share their desired screen or window for the presentation. If your presentation includes audio, please be sure to [share computer audio when sharing your screen](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063608#h_01GBXFBZ8GBD3Z3YV70YRETA7Y). The stream from the Zoom Webinar will include the presenter’s shared screen, audio, and video sources - all to be streamed to the in-person conference room A/V system and virtually over YouTube.
