{"v-full-1077":{"abstract":"A growing body of work draws on feminist thinking to challenge assumptions about how people engage with and use visualizations. This work draws on feminist values, driving design and research guidelines that account for the influences of power and neglect. This prior work is largely prescriptive, however, forgoing articulation of how feminist theories of knowledge \u2014 or feminist epistemology \u2014 can alter research design and outcomes. At the core of our work is an engagement with feminist epistemology, drawing attention to how a new framework for how we know what we know enabled us to overcome intellectual tensions in our research. Specifically, we focus on the theoretical concept of entanglement, central to recent feminist scholarship, and contribute: a history of entanglement in the broader scope of feminist theory; an articulation of the main points of entanglement theory for a visualization context; and a case study of research outcomes as evidence of the potential of feminist epistemology to impact visualization research. This work answers a call in the community to embrace a broader set of theoretical and epistemic foundations and provides a starting point for bringing feminist theories into visualization research.","accessible_pdf":true,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"email":"derya.akbaba@liu.se","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Derya Akbaba"},{"affiliations":["Emory University, Atlanta, United States"],"email":"lauren.klein@emory.edu","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Lauren Klein"},{"affiliations":["Link\u00f6ping University, N\u00f6rrkoping, Sweden"],"email":"miriah.meyer@liu.se","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Miriah Meyer"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Derya Akbaba"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/ubrdy/","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, both PCS and external","paper_award":"best","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/rw35g","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"cap1","slot_id":"v-full-1077","time_end":"2024-10-15T17:55:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-15T17:40:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-15T17:40:00Z","title":"Entanglements for Visualization: Changing Research Outcomes through Feminist Theory","uid":"v-full-1077","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""},"v-short-1090":{"abstract":"Visualizing high dimensional data is challenging, since any dimensionality reduction technique will distort distances.

However, the gap between common programmatic analysis (e.g., within computational notebooks) and exploratory visual analysis leads to a disjointed and inefficient data analysis experience. To bridge this gap, we developed PyGWalker, a Python library that offers on-the-fly assistance for exploratory visual data analysis. It features a lightweight and intuitive GUI with a shelf builder modality. Its loosely coupled architecture supports multiple computational environments to accommodate varying data sizes. Since its release in February 2023, PyGWalker has gained much attention, with 612k downloads on PyPI and over 10.5k stars on GitHub as of June 2024. This demonstrates its value to the data science and visualization community, with researchers and developers integrating it into their own applications and studies.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Kanaries Data Inc., Hangzhou, China"],"email":"yue.yu@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Yue Yu"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"lshenaj@connect.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Leixian Shen"},{"affiliations":["Kanaries Data Inc., Hangzhou, China"],"email":"feilong@kanaries.net","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Fei Long"},{"affiliations":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"email":"huamin@cse.ust.hk","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Huamin Qu"},{"affiliations":["Kanaries Data Inc., Hangzhou, China"],"email":"haochen@kanaries.net","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Hao Chen"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Yue Yu"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"","open_access_supplemental_question":"No","paper_award":"best","paper_type":"short","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11637","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"cap1","slot_id":"v-short-1150","time_end":"2024-10-15T15:32:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-15T15:21:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-15T15:21:00Z","title":"PyGWalker: On-the-fly Assistant for Exploratory Visual Data Analysis","uid":"v-short-1150","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""}}
