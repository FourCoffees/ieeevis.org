{"a-ldav-posters-1702":{"abstract":"This work explores the application of recent advancements in radiance field rendering, specifically 3D Gaussian splatting, to generate high-quality approximations of scientific data. In this technique, a 3D Gaussian splatting model is built from a 3D point cloud generated using structure-from-motion, or a randomly initialized one when using a NeRF as input. This point cloud serves as the basis for initializing a set of Gaussian primitives, which are then refined through machine learning to minimize differences between ground truth and rendered images. We modified this pipeline to train Gaussian models directly from scientific data, eliminating the need for structure-from-motion. We test exporting an isosurface as a point cloud, which is then used to train a Gaussian model representing the dataset's isosurface. We also experimented with using a cinema database to produce a 3D Gaussian model; however, this approach yielded less promising results due to sub-optimal point cloud initialization. Our findings highlight the potential of this technique for scientific datasets, suggesting it could enable efficient post-hoc visualization with reduced computational resources.","authors":[{"affiliations":["Utah State University, Logan, United States","Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"sewellandres@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Andres Role Sewell"},{"affiliations":["University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Landon Dyken"},{"affiliations":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Victor A.

The study reveals numerous limitations of the VAW project, including misleading color schemes, insufficient representation of data context and quality, and lack of diverse voices in data collection. The study calls for more culturally responsive data collection and nuanced visualization approaches to accurately portray and address GBV.

Visually assessing the quality of these models requires correlating features, predictions, and ground truth both globally and locally, which is challenging with multi-attribute data due to occlusion. To address this, we introduce Layer Toggling for instantaneously changing layer visibility using a physical button box, allowing comparison of spatially coherent views using retinal persistence. Visibility-preserving lenses dynamically adjust to the density of revealed features, facilitating the exploration of spatial (2D) and quantitative data (1D), such as temporal attributes.

Our interactive approach involves allowing the user to make selections on the text embedding and then utilizing a large-language model (LLM) for: getting a quick overview of the selection, identifying instances of miss-classification, understanding text data within a mixed-class selection, and suggesting additional labels that better fit the underlying text. We implemented our approach in a prototype application, Text-Embedding Selection Sidekick (TESS), and present our initial results.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, United States"],"email":"allen.detmer@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Allen Detmer"},{"affiliations":["University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Raj K Bhatnagar"},{"affiliations":["University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jillian Aurisano"}],"discord_channel":"https://discord.com/channels/1286338967674818684/1288497673212788798","event":"VIS Posters","event_prefix":"v-vis-posters","has_image":false,"has_poster_pdf":true,"has_summary_pdf":true,"title":"LLM Assisted Analysis of Text-Embedding Visualizations","uid":"v-vis-posters-1074"},"v-vis-posters-1075":{"abstract":"The think-aloud protocol has long been recognized as a useful tool for conducting user studies.

To address this problem, we introduce CrowdAloud, a user study platform for creating and analyzing crowd-sourced think-aloud studies. Utilizing audio and task-level provenance data, CrowdAloud provides the necessary conditions for think-aloud studies to be run as well as a qualitative analysis conducted on the results, without the technical overhead involved with an ad-hoc solution.

The most widely used remedy for making data visualizations accessible is text descriptions. Yet, manually creating useful text descriptions is often omitted by visualization authors, either because of a lack of awareness or a perceived burden. Automatically generated text descriptions are a potential partial remedy. However, with current methods it is unfeasible to create text descriptions for complex scientific charts. In this poster, we describe our methods for generating text descriptions for one complex scientific visualization: the UpSet plot. UpSet is a widely used technique for the visualization and analysis of sets and their intersections. At the same time, UpSet is arguably unfamiliar to novices and used mostly in scientific contexts. Generating text descriptions for UpSet plots is challenging because the patterns observed in UpSet plots have not been studied. We first analyze patterns present in dozens of published UpSet plots. We then introduce software that generates text descriptions for UpSet plots based on the patterns present in the chart. Finally, we introduce a web service that generates text descriptions based on a specification of an UpSet plot, and demonstrate its use in both an interactive web-based implementation and a static Python implementation of UpSet.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"ishratjahan.eliza@utah.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Ishrat Jahan Eliza"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jake Wagoner"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jack Wilburn"},{"affiliations":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Nate Lanza"},{"affiliations":["University College London, London, United Kingdom"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Daniel Hajas"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Alexander Lex"}],"discord_channel":"https://discord.com/channels/1286338967674818684/1288497673212788798","event":"VIS Posters","event_prefix":"v-vis-posters","has_image":false,"has_poster_pdf":true,"has_summary_pdf":true,"title":"Enhancing Accessibility of UpSet Plots with Text Descriptions","uid":"v-vis-posters-1076"},"v-vis-posters-1077":{"abstract":"Reeb graphs are a topological analysis tool useful for abstracting data across various fields, e.g., medical imaging and geography.

While a long line of research in the visualization community has sought to identify 'best design practices' to make visualizations more interpretable, the community has yet to articulate how the presence of specific design features contributes to whether a visualization is deemed overwhelming or overly complex. As an initial exploration into this gap, we augmented the MASSVIS dataset, one of the most comprehensive static visualization datasets to-date, with visual complexity ratings and also novel metadata capturing design features related to text, color, underlying data, and chart types. We examined distributions of visual design features across visualizations in the MASSVIS dataset and compared their effects on complexity. Intuitively, we find that higher quantities of visual elements are associated with higher ratings of complexity. Moreover, we determine that visualizations with certain designs (e.g., diagrams) are associated with higher ratings of complexity as opposed to visualizations without, while other design features are associated with lower ratings (e.g., captions).","authors":[{"affiliations":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"email":"klin368@gatech.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Kylie R.

In this work, we perform a mixed-methods study, where participants engage in a visual stenography task in which they re-draw line charts, to solicit information about the visual features that participants believe to be important in line charts and how faithfully and accurately they recreate them. We identified three predominant strategies, whose use correlated with the noise present in the stimuli: the replicators attempted to retain all major features of the line chart; the trend keepers faithfully retained trends but no other features; and the overwhelmed only represented the noise. Further, we found that participants tended to faithfully retain trends and peaks and valleys when these features were present, while periodicity and noise were represented in more qualitative or gestural ways: semantically rather than accurately. These results suggest a need to consider more flexible and human-centric ways of presenting, summarizing, pre-processing, or clustering time series data.","authors":[{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"u1450373@umail.utah.edu","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Rifat Ara Proma"},{"affiliations":["Northeastern University, Portland, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Michael Correll"},{"affiliations":["University of Oklahoma, Norman, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri"},{"affiliations":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States"],"email":"","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Paul Rosen"}],"discord_channel":"https://discord.com/channels/1286338967674818684/1288497673212788798","event":"VIS Posters","event_prefix":"v-vis-posters","has_image":true,"has_poster_pdf":true,"has_summary_pdf":true,"title":"Visual Stenography: Feature Recreation and Preservation in Sketches of Line Charts","uid":"v-vis-posters-1100"},"v-vis-posters-1101":{"abstract":"We present a novel transformation method that converts extensive Earth science datasets into various 3D representations for narrative data visualizations.
