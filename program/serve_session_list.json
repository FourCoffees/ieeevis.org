Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations from natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable benchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs\u2019 capabilities in visualization generation. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS benchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale dataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146 databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematically scanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEval provides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes. We run VisEval on a series of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals prevalent challenges and delivers essential insights for future advancements.","accessible_pdf":false,"authors":[{"affiliations":["Microsoft Research, Shanghai, China"],"email":"christy05.chen@gmail.com","is_corresponding":true,"name":"Nan Chen"},{"affiliations":["Microsoft Research, Shanghai, China"],"email":"scottyugochang@gmail.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuge Zhang"},{"affiliations":["Microsoft Research, Shanghai, China"],"email":"jiahangxu@microsoft.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Jiahang Xu"},{"affiliations":["ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"email":"rk.ren@outlook.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Kan Ren"},{"affiliations":["Microsoft Research, Shanghai, China"],"email":"yuqyang@microsoft.com","is_corresponding":false,"name":"Yuqing Yang"}],"bunny_ff_link":"","bunny_ff_subtitles":"","bunny_prerecorded_link":"","bunny_prerecorded_subtitles":"","contributors":["Nan Chen"],"doi":"","external_paper_link":"","fno":"","has_image":false,"has_pdf":false,"image_caption":"","keywords":[],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/microsoft/VisEval","open_access_supplemental_question":"Yes, both PCS and external","paper_award":"best","paper_type":"full","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00981","presentation_mode":"","session_id":"gov1","slot_id":"v-full-1332","time_end":"2024-10-12T00:45:00Z","time_stamp":"2024-10-12T00:35:00Z","time_start":"2024-10-12T00:35:00Z","title":"VisEval: A Benchmark for Data Visualization in the Era of Large Language Models","uid":"v-full-1332","youtube_ff_id":"","youtube_ff_link":"","youtube_prerecorded_id":"","youtube_prerecorded_link":""}],"time_start":"2024-10-12T00:35:00Z","title":"VIS Governance","track":"bayshore1","youtube_id":"qfxUt9UM0nc","youtube_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfxUt9UM0nc","zoom_broadcast_link":"","zoom_private_link":"","zoom_private_meeting":"","zoom_private_password":""}]}}
